## Short Case
Going into this I had no clue on how to execute my idea nor had any abstract image except that I wanted to tweet about important metrics in set intervals.
Commingling my private account and the price alert account was not idea so I first began by figuring out how to set up a twitter developer account and a seperate unique gmail account. After this, It was time to understand how to use Twitters API and after some poking around I decided to use Tweepy. Tweepy is a library that allows easy access to twitters API without getting bogged down in the details and fluff. 

Once I was able to send out tweets, it was easy to attach market data and an Image to every tweet. One issue had somewhat of a difficulty was overlaying the price to an image and making sure it was aligned properly. Other than that this project was not too difficult. For the future, I could change the core functionality of sending out tweets every three hours to sending out a tweet based on some market condition that is met, for example, if the price changed by 15% in the last 30 minutes.
